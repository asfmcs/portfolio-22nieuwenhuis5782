    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a stantadrd markup language that creates web pages, for example, this web site where you are reading this, and applications. Using HTML, we can create so many features in a web page or aplication. We are able to create links within a web page, having a table of contents which helps us navigate in the web page created. We can also able create lists, numberd or unnumbered, which helps organize ideas, points, and make well, lists. We are also able to create tables, for example, to show statistics, or quanities of ingrediants in a recepie. We are also able to write paragraphs, such as the one you are reading right now. We can also include headings, we write them by using h1 though h7 depending in the size you want, h1 being the biggest and h7 being the smallest. We have also learned to center our work, by adding a center code between the item we want centered.

    Continuing in what we learned about HTML, we figured that we can add images of our choise, and put them in a specific size, we can also have letters, words or even a sentence, or the whole paragraph, in <strong>bold</strong>, or <em>italics.</em> HTML is a language that we need to create a webpage, and helps us to be able to execute creating a webpage. Everything in HTML needs to be put into brackets for the code to work. We write it like this: < code you want to execute >, what we write inside the brackets are, for example, "strong" to be able to put into bold, "em" for italics, "center" for centeirng your work, "h1" to create a heading, and so much more codes we can use to be able to format our webpage as we want it to show.

   <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that helps us format and make our webpage presentable. By using CSS we are able to add a colored background, and a border to the background. We can also put a image to the backgroud. We can also put text in different: sizes, fonts, color, thickness, hightlight, shade and shadow, and so much more features. We are also able to edit images and make them into the shape and size we want. We are able to make what we wish to me a certain size, color, etc. We code CSS by putting what we want to change first, for example, we write h1 then these brackets { the font, size, color etc. we want}. </p>

  <p>CSS makes our webpages colorful, organized, and eye catching. We can see that CSS is a powerful tool, which makes a webpage be presentable. We can modify how we want to see things in our webpages, we are able to edit the visuals in our webpage and are able to change from the original font that appears on by default. We can transform the web page to looking from plain white with black text to looking modern, inovating and eye catching for the viewers.</p>
